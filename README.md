### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2024 graduate from the University of Melbourne, passionate about systems programming, backend development, and understanding how things work under the hood. 

I enjoy working with C, Go, and Python, and I'm especially interested in projects that touch on networking, operating systems, or distributed systems. Whether it's building a proxy server from scratch or designing backend APIs, I love writing clean, efficient, and purposeful code.

Currently exploring:
- Low-level systems and performance optimization
- Backend architectures and service design
- Open source contributions and personal tools

*Always learning, always building.*

Feel free to check out my projects or reach out if you want to collaborate!
