# Filip Madyarov — Full Stack Engineer

I’m a 2024 Computer Science graduate from the University of Melbourne with a strong interest in backend engineering, systems programming, and building towards service design for large scale applications or personal tools.

I build systems that are reliable, efficient, and maintainable. I’m most passionate about solving backend problems that involve performance, networking, and architecture.
